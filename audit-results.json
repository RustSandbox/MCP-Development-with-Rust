An attacker may be able to use that information to recover the key.\n\n### Patches\nNo patch is yet available, however work is underway to migrate to a fully constant-time implementation.\n\n### Workarounds\nThe only currently available workaround is to avoid using the `rsa` crate in settings where attackers are able to observe timing information, e.g. local use on a non-compromised computer is fine.\n\n### References\nThis vulnerability was discovered as part of the \"[Marvin Attack]\", which revealed several implementations of RSA including OpenSSL had not properly mitigated timing sidechannel attacks.\n\n[Marvin Attack]: https://people.redhat.com/~hkario/marvin/","date":"2023-11-22","aliases":["CVE-2023-49092","GHSA-c38w-74pg-36hr","GHSA-4grx-2x9w-596c"],"related":[],"collection":"crates","categories":["crypto-failure"],"keywords":["cryptography"],"cvss":"CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N","informational":null,"references":["https://people.redhat.com/~hkario/marvin/"],"source":null,"url":"https://github.com/RustCrypto/RSA/issues/19#issuecomment-1822995643","withdrawn":null,"license":"CC0-1.0"},"versions":{"patched":[],"unaffected":[]},"affected":null,"package":{"name":"rsa","version":"0.9.8","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index","checksum":"78928ac1ed176a5ca1d17e578a1825f3d81ca54cf41053a592584b020cfd691b","dependencies":[{"name":"const-oid","version":"0.9.6","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"},{"name":"digest","version":"0.10.7","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"},{"name":"num-bigint-dig","version":"0.8.4","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"},{"name":"num-integer","version":"0.1.46","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"},{"name":"num-traits","version":"0.2.19","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"},{"name":"pkcs1","version":"0.7.5","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"},{"name":"pkcs8","version":"0.10.2","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"},{"name":"rand_core","version":"0.6.4","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"},{"name":"signature","version":"2.2.0","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"},{"name":"spki","version":"0.7.3","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"},{"name":"subtle","version":"2.6.1","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"},{"name":"zeroize","version":"1.8.1","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index"}],"replace":null}}]},"warnings":{"unmaintained":[{"kind":"unmaintained","package":{"name":"paste","version":"1.0.15","source":"registry+https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io-index","checksum":"57c0d7b74b563b49d38dae00a0c37d4d6de9b432382b2892f0574ddcae73fd0a","replace":null},"advisory":{"id":"RUSTSEC-2024-0436","package":"paste","title":"paste - no longer maintained","description":"The creator of the crate `paste` has stated in the [`README.md`](https://github.com/dtolnay/paste/blob/master/README.md) \nthat this project is not longer maintained as well as archived the repository","date":"2024-10-07","aliases":[],"related":[],"collection":"crates","categories":[],"keywords":[],"cvss":null,"informational":"unmaintained","references":[],"source":null,"url":"https://github.com/dtolnay/paste","withdrawn":null,"license":"CC0-1.0"},"affected":null,"versions":{"patched":[],"unaffected":[]}}]}}
