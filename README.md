## 🚀 **Getting Started**

### Prerequisites
- **Rust 1.70+** installed ([Installation Guide](https://rustup.rs/))
- **Basic terminal/command line** knowledge
- **Text editor or IDE** (VS Code recommended with rust-analyzer)

### Quick Start (Choose Your Path)

**Option 1: Install from crates.io (Recommended)**
```bash
# Add as dependency in your Cargo.toml
[dependencies]
mcp_rust_examples = "0.1.0"

# Or install binaries globally
cargo install mcp_rust_examples --features examples-only

# Run examples directly
example_01_hello_world
example_02_calculator
```

**Option 2: Clone and Build (Development)**
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RustSandbox/MCP-Development-with-Rust
cd MCP-Development-with-Rust

# Run any of the 20 working examples
cargo run --bin example_01_hello_world
cargo run --bin example_13_auth_service
cargo run --bin example_20_enterprise_server

# Follow the technical reference guide
open mcp_rust_tutorial.md
```

**Option 3: Learning-Oriented Approach**
```bash
# Start with the international teaching guide
open mcp_rust_tutorial_international.md

# Follow the structured learning path
cargo new mcp_learning_project
cd mcp_learning_project
# Continue with Chapter 2 of the international guide
```
